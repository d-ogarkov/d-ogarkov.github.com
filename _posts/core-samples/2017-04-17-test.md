This Jekyll introduction will outline specifically  what Jekyll is and why you would want to use it.
Directly following the intro we'll learn exactly _how_ Jekyll does what it does.

## Overview

### What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from
dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".

### Examples

This website is created with Jekyll. [Other Jekyll websites](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites).

### Working With Pages

**Creating a Page**
Pages are created by properly formatting a file and placing it anywhere in the root directory or subdirectories that do _not_ start with an underscore.

**Formatting**
In order to register as a Jekyll page the file must contain [YAML Front-Matter](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter).
Registering a page means 1) that Jekyll will process the page and 2) that the page object will be available in the `site.pages` array for inclusion into your templates.
